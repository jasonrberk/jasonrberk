[jason.r.berk@gmail.com](mailto:jason.r.berk@gmail.com)

I am a highly motivated and self-driven individual looking for a full-stack software engineering position. I bring a long history of delivering impactful contributions to a wide range of projects.  I am passionate about software development and pride myself on writing clean, maintainable code.  I have experience with, and enjoy contributing to, DevOps and CI/CD practices.  Most importantly, I am seeking a position utilizing my experience to contribute technical leadership across the organization.   

## Experience

09/2022 - Present

* [Bonterra](https://www.bonterratech.com/) - Senior Software Engineer / Architect 
  * Providing AWS leadership.  Advancing the usages of Terraform and overall module management and creation.
  * Rearchitecting integrations with Docusign and Adobe to implement more secure OAuth strategies and leverage webhook callbacks instead of polling.

2014 - 09/2022

* [NextGear Capital](https://www.nextgearcapital.com/) - Senior Software Engineer
  * Led a complete rebuild of our Graylog cluster utilizing AWS EC2 / OpenSearch and SaltStack config management with Python/Jinja.  
    * By adjusting global logging configuration, retention and rotation policies of stored logs and correctly sizing infrastructure I estimate savings of roughly $7,500/month while increasing production log retention.
  * I implemented a custom version of [https://runatlantis.io](https://runatlantis.io) allowing over 50 engineers to manage their own Terraform (TF) across roughly 30 AWS accounts.  
    * This new system enforces company rules around the PR process and provides auditability.  I gained experience with TF, Docker, Fargate and ExpressJS on this project.
  * I was pivotal in the creation of our “CTOR” tooling used by 50+ feature team engineers to bootstrap everything needed to create a new microservice:  
    * GitHub/DTR/nexus repos
    * Scaffolding code for both APIs using SpringBoot and UIs in ReactJS
    * CI/CD jobs in Jenkins
    * Spring cloud config stubs
    * Artifact exploit scanning with Veracode
  * I helped design and build our Veracode / Rally Issue Tracker integration.  This tooling synchronizes defects based on Veracode scan results each night.  This helps developers identify regressions faster and increases overall security posture.
  * I have created and supported multiple SpringBoot microservices and various internal libraries used by over 90 internal applications.  I am also specifically responsible for most Spring Security components and OAuth2 solutions using Okta and PingFederate.
  * Developed and maintained multiple Terraform modules and Terragrunt tooling at an organization level to enforce policies around AWS usage and security.

2013 - 2014 

* Interactive Intelligence (ININ), Senior Software Engineer

  * At ININ, I was a member of an integrated delivery team, working in an agile environment to design, develop, and maintain integrations between 3rd party products and internal tools.  
  * I also contributed to the next generation of cloud native call center tools intended to replace all customer managed on-premise solutions.

2008 - 2013 

* Purdue Federal Credit Union - Software Developer

  * At Purdue Federal, I helped develop numerous online banking tools.  My most impactful contribution was the complete rewrite of the monthly statement generation process.
    * I converted an overly complex system with many points of unrecoverable failure and a multi-day runtime into a streamlined process that ran in hours.  
    * By using better data extraction techniques, RDS storage, *NIX tooling and PDF generation tools I was able to convert exported server data at month end to online statements in the same day.  
    * Working directly with our mail vendor to rework paper statement printing and mailing resulted in roughly $15,000/month in bottom line savings.
    * My new process also provided the ability for targeted marketing and better analytics.

2000 - 2007 

* Purdue University - Software Developer

  * While at Purdue University I gained experience in Apache, Perl, Java and *NIX tools.  I worked directly with WebCT integrations and for the IAM department to increase software security practices at the university across different departments.

## Education
